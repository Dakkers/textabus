TextABus
========

my first (and therefore probably awfully written) Android app. it allows you to save bus stops as list items, each with a name and number. clicking on the list item will send a text to GRT (57555) for you, by default. you can change the number you want to send a text to by clicking on the Settings button.

## Features
- adding / editing / removing stops
- specifying what number to text

## TODO
- ~~add in settings page so users can change the phone number that is texted (so people from different cities can use it)~~
- ~~update the design, it's pretty bland.~~
- update button sizes. they're a bit too small, it seems.
- ~~sort the data by name~~
- ~~CODE CLEANUP PLS~~
- ~~change name of app~~
- Pebble integration (that was actually the purpose in the beginning)
