GRTexter
========

my first (and therefore probably awfully written) Android app. it allows you to save bus stops as list items, each with a name and number. clicking on the list item will send a text to GRT (57555) for you, by default. you can change the number you want to send a text to by clicking on the Settings button.

## Features
- adding / editing / removing stops
- specifying what number to text

## TODO
- ~~add in settings page so users can change the phone number that is texted (so people from different cities can use it)~~
- update the design, it's pretty bland.
- update button sizes. they're a bit too small, it seems.
- ~~sort the data by name~~
- CODE CLEANUP PLS
- change name of app

## License
how does this work? I don't know. please don't duplicate this and then sell it or claim it as your own. feel free to copy and paste the code that you need, though. hopefully my code isn't too horrible for people looking for examples.
