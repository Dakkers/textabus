## [V 0.2.0 (Beta)](https://github.com/StDako/textabus/commit/dded14d59d9396190abab46bea73e279e0c1d3aa)
Fully functional, i.e. SMS messages can be sent to a specified number, stops can be added/edited/removed, etc.

## [V 0.1.0 (Alpha?)](https://github.com/StDako/textabus/commit/6ec79899098d04e1d2929fda36c073a6527e4218)
Almost entirely functional, except for a major flaw: initial use of the app would not properly define the SMS number. This wasn't obvious to me, because the app had already been installed.
